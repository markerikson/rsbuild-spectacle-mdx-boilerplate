#### React-Redux vNext?

- Current version: v7.2
  - Stable, no immediate plans for changes
- Long-term question: Concurrent Mode and Suspense
  - External state tools will have issues with Concurrent Mode because React wants to own state updates and reorder them
  - React team created [new experimental `useMutableSource` hook](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/147) specifically for use with external state tools like Redux
- Will likely build React-Redux v8 around `useMutableSource` whenever CM finally is ready
  - Not 100% sure that `connect` will be fully CM-compat (might just take extra work)

import useDispatch from "./examples/useDispatch";

#### React-Redux: `useDispatch()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={useDispatch}>{`
- Returns the store's \`dispatch\` method
- Differences from \`connect\` and \`mapDispatch\`:
  - Equivalent to calling \`connect\` with no \`mapDispatch\` argument
  - No "binding action creators" any more - up to you to call \`dispatch()\` in your own handlers
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>
